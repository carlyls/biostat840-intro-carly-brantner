    "text": "Here, I will display a brief data analysis of schooling policies during the fall of 2020 (in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic). The data I am using is from MCH Strategic Data (“Covid-19 Impact: School District Operational Status” 2021) and was pulled on November 7, 2022 but represents data from fall 2020. In this analysis, we will be asking the questions: which states had the highest percentage of districts that were fully virtual during the fall of 2020? What about hybrid and fully onsite? We will also investigate the student masking policies for different states, and we will explore the previous questions at the US region level.\nThe intended audience of this data analysis is school policy makers and local governance boards who are interested in how their state compared to other states across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe MCH data on school district operational statuses reports the delivery mode of a school district in the fall of 2020. Data were collected by reaching out to individual districts, and updates to the dataset were not at regular time increments; we therefore use the finalized version of the fall 2020 dataset. For each district, we have information about whether they are public, private, or catholic, their state, enrollment numbers, and their policies. These policies include the delivery mode characterization (online only, hybrid, on premises, pending, unknown, or other), along with information about specific requirements such as student masking and staff masking."

We saw that the majority of districts operated in a hybrid mode. We saw that the average enrollment for districts that operated fully onsite was the smallest (1,689), followed by hybrid (3,101) and then by online districts (5,679). We then investigated mitigation measures and found that for onsite districts, a higher percentage required staff masking than student masking, and there were regional differences in the percentages requiring each group to wear masks. Specifically, the northeast had the highest percentage of onsite districts requiring masks for all students (90.4%) and all staff (91.5%). The lowest percentage of districts requiring all students to wear masks was the southwest (49.2%), and the lowest percentage of districts requiring all staff to wear masks was the southeast (69.7%). For more analysis of this data and similar data on school policy, I wrote a paper comparing several sources measuring school delivery mode during the pandemic (Lupton-Smith et al. 2021)."

(Lessler et al. 2021) investigated the relationship between school delivery mode and risk of COVID-19 at the household level. They then go a step further to analyze the relationship between specific mitigation measures and the odds of catching COVID-19 or a similar illness. One figure from their paper is included here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n(Lessler et al. 2021) demonstrate in the following figure that certain mitigation measures are associated with a decreased risk of getting Covid like illness, loss of taste/smell, or a positive COVID-19 test result.

We can see that student and teacher masking both are associated with a reduction in risk for students attending school onsite.\n\n\n\nOdds ratio of COVID-related outcome by mitigation measure\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above results, we investigate the percentage of districts with a delivery mode of fully onsite that include a mask policy for all students, and a mask policy for all staff.\n\nop_policy <- mch %>%\n  filter(Mode == \"Onsite\") %>%\n  group_by(State, Region) %>%\n  summarise(StudentMask = sum(StudentMaskPolicy == \"Required for all students\")/n(),\n            StaffMask = sum(StaffMaskPolicy == \"Required for all staff\")/n()) %>%\n  arrange(StudentMask)\n\nop_policy %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=factor(State, levels=op_policy$State), y=StudentMask)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region, scales=\"free_x\") +\n  xlab(\"State\") + ylab(\"Percent with Student Mask Required\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Districts that Require All Students to Mask\",\n          subtitle = \"Fall 2020\",\n       caption= \"Including public districts who taught fully onsite\")\n\n\n\n\n\nmch %>%\n  filter(Mode == \"Onsite\") %>%\n  group_by(Region) %>%\n  summarise(StudentMask = sum(StudentMaskPolicy == \"Required for all students\")/n(),\n            StudentMask = round(100*mean(StudentMask),1)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(StudentMask)) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl(col.names = c(\"Region\", \"Percentage of Districts with Student Masking Required\"),\n               caption = \"Percentage of Onsite Districts in each US Region that Require Masking for All Students\")\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Onsite Districts in each US Region that Require Masking for All Students\n \n  \n    Region \n    Percentage of Districts with Student Masking Required \n  \n \n\n  \n    Northeast \n    90.4 \n  \n  \n    Midwest \n    63.6 \n  \n  \n    West \n    62.3 \n  \n  \n    Southeast \n    54.5 \n  \n  \n    Southwest \n    49.2 \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can see that onsite districts in the northeast had a much higher percentage requiring masking for all students (90.4%) compared to districts in the southeast (54.5%) and southwest (49.2%).\nFinally, we can look at staff masking.\n\nop_staffpolicy <- arrange(op_policy, StaffMask)\nop_staffpolicy %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=factor(State, levels=op_staffpolicy$State), y=StaffMask)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~Region, scales=\"free_x\") +\n  xlab(\"State\") + ylab(\"Percent with Staff Mask Required\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Districts that Require All Staff to Mask\",\n          subtitle = \"Fall 2020\",\n       caption= \"Including public districts who taught fully onsite\")\n\n\n\n\n\nmch %>%\n  filter(Mode == \"Onsite\") %>%\n  group_by(Region) %>%\n  summarise(StaffMask = sum(StaffMaskPolicy == \"Required for all staff\")/n(),\n            StaffMask = round(100*mean(StaffMask),1)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(StaffMask)) %>%\n  kableExtra::kbl(col.names = c(\"Region\", \"Percentage of Districts with Staff Masking Required\"),\n               caption = \"Percentage of Onsite Districts in each US Region that Require Masking for All Staff\")\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Onsite Districts in each US Region that Require Masking for All Staff\n \n  \n    Region \n    Percentage of Districts with Staff Masking Required \n  \n \n\n  \n    Northeast \n    91.5 \n  \n  \n    West \n    73.2 \n  \n  \n    Southwest \n    72.6 \n  \n  \n    Midwest \n    71.9 \n  \n  \n    Southeast \n    69.7 \n  \n\n\n\n\nWe see that each region had a higher percentage of onsite districts requiring staff masking than the percentage requiring student masking."
